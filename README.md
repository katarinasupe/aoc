<h1 align="center">:sparkles: Advent of code :sparkles:</h1>

Decided to make a repository of my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). The solutions are written in Python.

In the year 2021 I started bravely, but finished pretty quickly ðŸ˜¥


My goal for this year is to be better than last year. Therefore, if I manage to find time, will and knowledge to solve 6 days, I will be happy. But, let's make it at least 10. In the end, I will be happy if I become better in Python by seeing other cool solutions.
